iaeste-conference-app
=====================

This is an app intended for phones running Android 2.1 Eclair or later, which supports IAESTE conferences. It allows delegates to access an itinerary, organiser phone numbers, a list of other delegates, a (cached) local map, and the Facebook page / website for the conference. The goal of this project is to produce an app which contains all the important information typically found in a 'welcome pack'. Currently it must be re-branded for each conference where it used.
